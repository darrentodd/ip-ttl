# ip-ttl

ttl is a linux netfilter kernel module that rewrites the IP Time To Live (TTL) field.
Currently only IPv4 is supported. The IP packets that are altered are selected based on the
source port - with the percentage of traffic configurable.

# Download:

  $ git clone https://github.com/pmcgleenon/ip-ttl

# Building:

you'll need to install the kernel-devel rpm 

   $ make clean all

# Running: 

   $ modinfo ttl.ko

you can load the module with no parameters, in which case it will rewrite 50% of the traffic 
with the IP TTL value set to one less than the current default value (i.e. ttl = ttl - 1):

   $ insmod ttl.ko 

specify a ttl_value to use this as the TTL; the debug_enabled argument enables debug logs: 

   $ insmod ttl.ko debug_enabled=1 ttl_value=40

specify a perc value to alter the amount of traffic to apply the new TTL to; ie 25%:

   $ insmod ttl.ko perc=25 ttl_value=40
